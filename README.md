US/EE Keyboard Layout
=====================

An U.S. keyboard layout with Estonian keys and the Euro-sign for Mac OS X.
I really dislike swapping keyboard layouts all the time and using the Estonian layout for programming is no good.

This is a "port" of the immensely useful "US keyboard with Estonian letters" Linux keyboard layout.

## Installation

```
mkdir -p ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts; \
curl -Sso ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/us_ee.keylayout https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahoa/us-ee-keylayout-osx/master/us_ee.keylayout \
     -Sso ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/us_ee.icns https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahoa/us-ee-keylayout-osx/master/us_ee.icns
```

## Differences from the Standard U.S. Layout

| ⌥ + ]             | õ         |
| ⌥ + '             | ä         |
| ⌥ + ;             | ö         |
| ⌥ + [             | ü         |
| ⌥ + s             | š         |
| ⌥ + z             | ž         |
| ⇧ + 4             | €         |
| ⌥ + e             | €         |
| ⇧ + ⌥ + ]         | Õ         |
| ⇧ + ⌥ + '         | Ä         |
| ⇧ + ⌥ + ;         | Ö         |
| ⇧ + ⌥ + [         | Ü         |
| ⇧ + ⌥ + s         | Š         |
| ⇧ + ⌥ + z         | Ž         |

Created with the wonderful Ukelele OS X keyboard layout editor.
